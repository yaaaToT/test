This project was initiated on January 4, 2025 (approximately) for the infantry "charm" in the RoboMaster competition in the 2025 season. 
Updates essentially ceased at the end of March. Due to personal abilities, skill levels, and various technical shortcomings in the initial stage, 
the project underwent continuous modifications and iterations.  Additionally, I drew inspiration and utilized some ideas from others, 
for which I would like to express my gratitude.  Due to various environmental and certain people factors, the project was discontinued. 
I should not have been responsible for this project, but due to special reasons, I took over.  Now, I am no longer required to work on it.
Regardless, writing this project taught me a lot and helped me grow personally.  This serves as a "commemoration" for me.
